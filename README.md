perl-socket-bitstamp
====================

Perl module for BitStamp socket connection.

These perl modules have not been extensively tested. Please use with caution.

There is no documentation (pods) yet. But the test.pl file should get you started.

A proper Perl module will be coming for CPAN soon.
